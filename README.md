A place to store and share artwork recreated for use on 105 series Alfas.

The quadrifoglio logo was pulled from period photos of unrestored 1600 GTAs. I was unsatisfied with the available repros, which are digitally printed vinyl stickers with jagged pixelation. Originals are 150mm wide water transfer decals. The repros also seem to use the wrong artwork, stem coming from 6 o'clock, where images I found had stems coming from 3 and 9 o'clock.

You'll need to make two of the points-right (LH fender & rear) and one of the points-left (RH fender). Fender stems point towards the rear of the car, and the rear stem points right. Cut lines are magenta.

I intend to have these laser printed on white waterslide stock using a green spot color (TBD).
