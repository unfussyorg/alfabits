A place to store and share artwork recreated for use on 105 series Alfas.

The quadrifoglio logo was pulled from period photos of 1600 GTAs and brochure scans from an alfabb member. Available reproductions I could find were pixelated prints on vinyl sticker. Repros also use uncommon artwork, with stems at 6 o'clock. Originals seem to have had stems at 3 and 9 o'clock.

You'll need to make two of the points-right (LH fender & rear) and one of the points-left (RH fender). Fender stems point towards the rear of the car, and the rear stem points right.

Originals are 150mm wide water transfer decals. I intend to have these laser printed on white waterslide stock using a green spot color (TBD). I assume the materials will need to take UV into account. Cut lines are in magenta.
