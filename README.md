A place to store and share artwork recreated for use on 105 series Alfas.

The quadrifoglio logo was pulled from period photos of 1600 GTAs. I was unsatisfied with available repros sold by Alfa shops, which are pixelated digital prints on vinyl sticker. Originals are 150mm wide water transfer decals. The repros also seem to use the wrong artwork, with stems at 6 o'clock, where originals I found have stems at 3 and 9 o'clock.

You'll need to make two of the points-right (LH fender & rear) and one of the points-left (RH fender). Fender stems point towards the rear of the car, and the rear stem points right.

I intend to have these laser printed on white waterslide stock using a green spot color (TBD). Cut lines are in magenta.
